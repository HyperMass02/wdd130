                    2. Follow Guide Instructions: Listen carefully to your guide's safety briefing and follow their commands during the trip.
                    3. Stay in the Raft: Hold onto the raft and safety ropes to avoid falling out during rapids.
                    4. Use Proper Paddling Techniques: Learn and use correct paddling techniques to navigate safely.
                    5. Be Alert: Watch for hazards like rocks and strong currents, and be aware of other rafts.
                    6. Communicate and Cooperate: Work as a team with your rafting group and guide.
                    7. Know Emergency Procedures: Understand how to respond if someone falls out and be prepared for emergencies.
                    8. Respect Conditions: Check weather and water levels beforehand and choose an appropriate trip for your skill level.
                    9. Know Your Limits: Choose trips that match your abilities and physical fitness.

                <h1 class="question">What fun activitys do you have?</h1>
                <h2 class="answer">1. River Games: During breaks or calmer sections of the river, guides sometimes organize games like splash wars (using paddles to splash water at each other), 
                    raft surfing (riding waves in the raft), or raft-based competitions.
                    2. Swimming: Depending on the river and safety conditions, you might have opportunities to swim in calmer sections or designated swimming spots along the route.
                    3. Scenic Views: Enjoying the natural beauty and wildlife along the river is always a highlight. Guides often share information about local flora, fauna, and geological features.
                    4. Photography: Capture memorable moments and scenic views with waterproof cameras or phones in secure cases.
                    5. Team Bonding: Rafting requires teamwork, so bonding with your fellow rafters and guide can be a fun and rewarding part of the experience.
                    6. Celebration: After completing a thrilling section of rapids or the entire trip, celebrating with your group can be a fun way to cap off the adventure.</h2>
